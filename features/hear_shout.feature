Feature: Hear shout

  If someone shouts something, anyone nearby
  can hear that shout as long as they're within
  1km of the shouter.

  Rules:
  - Shout range is 1km
  - Geo location must be on
  - Network must be on

  Questions:
  - Do hears shouts disappear when we move away?
  - Do people need an account to shout? Or to listen?
  - How much precision do we need for distance?
